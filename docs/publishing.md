# Publishing to the Apple Store

## Rationale

Why?

## XCode instructions

In 2019, most developers can and should use XCode to set themselves up.

Or link to other docs from Apple to set yourself up with the Apple store.
A lot has changed since 2016!

## Obtaining isign files from XCode/Keychain

Update docs from setup docs, or link to same

## Resign app

Usual instructions, but are there any twists for the store?

We do not need a provisioning profile.

Mention possibility of Signer module.

## Submitting app to app store

Work out what APIs, or other interfaces, can or should be used

Can we trick XCode into doing this for us?
